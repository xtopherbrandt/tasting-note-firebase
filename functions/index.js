// When a version of the action is submitted for Beta or Production, 
// Actions on Google takes a snapshot of the current DiagloFlow state, including the fulfillment route.
// However the firebase function code is not part of the snapshot. Meaning that changes to the fulfillment function (in firebase)
// will affect a released version of the action, if the function named in the fulfillment route is same as the
// function being changed.
//
// To allow the firebase function to be independently maintained without affecting released versions of the action,
// each release of the action will target a function versioned by name
// the naming scheme is: '/fulfillment_{version.major}_{version.minor}'
// example: '/fulfillment_2019_10'
//
// When deploying a version for the first time be sure to NOT delete any previous versions
//
// The version of the function should match the git branch name
